            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so you can recall specific versions later. VC is benefical to many professional in the IT community such as developers, designers, social media managers, etc. Version control enables you to create, save, edit, and then save again. All the files are held in one main repository where they are accessible by any. This enables co workers or fellow project workers the opportunity to edit, change, and save the same files you work on. Saving these files, pushing, or committing will take all the changes and push it to the repository for others to see. The VCS is aware who changes, when they change it, what is different, and when to merge changes to the same file. Some benefits to VCS are that there is a common repository that is accessible to any member. People can work simultaneously on the same files without any problem. You are also allowed to return to an older version if needed. </p>

            <p class="lead"> There are many types of version control systems; they help keep tabs on current and previous files and directories. Many peoples method is to copy files into another directory, but this could lead to error. Local VCSs were developed to help steer clear of this issue by keeping a simple database where all file changes were under revision control. A popular VCS tool that is still used today on most Mac OS X operating systems is the RCS command. This version control system tool works by keeping patch sets, difference between files, in a special format on a disk. The disk could re-create or add what any file looked like by adding up all the patches. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Fellow developers needed a space to collaborate with other developers on other systems. Centralized Version Control was developed for this purpose. The system has one server that contains all the versioned files, and tabs on the clients who check out the files. Examples of these CVCS systems are CVS, Subversion, and Perforce. There are many advantages to using this system; everyone knows to a degree what everyone else is doing on the project. Also the boss is able to control the management of it employees more efficiently.  A huge disadvantage that local VCSs suffer from is corruption, server problems, and losing absolutely everything.  If the server is down, then there is no connection to collaborate or save the edited version. If the hard disk fails then things become corrupted. The main problem is having the entire project in one place could result in losing it all.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Distributed VCS</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Distributed Version Control Systems solve the issue of risking the loss of all your files. DVCS users donâ€™t just check out the most recent snapshot of the file but they instead fully mirror the repository. So if any problems with the server occur then these systems being used to collaborate it could be copied back to the server to help restore it. Unlike local and centralized version control, every clone is a full backup of all the data needed. These systems come into contact with multiple remote repositories they are able to work with; this enables collaboration with many different groups in many ways at the same time. Examples of Distributed version control systems are GIT, Mercurial, Bazaar, and Darcs.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What is Git?
                <span class="text-muted">A collection of snapshots</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Git was an offspring of the doomed relationship between the people of the Linux kernel, an open source software project, that began using a DVCS called Bit Keeper When the relationship broke, the tools from Bit keeper were revoked. Linux, inspired by the structure of Bit Keeper, created a new system that was built off of speed and a simple design that is fully distributed and able to handle large projects. Git was then created in 2005 and was a branching system for non-linear development. Git works by saving sets of snapshots of a miniature file system. Those snapshots are initiated by a commit or save in Git done by the user. When you commit it stores all the snapshots of all the files at that particular moment. The advantages of Git are plentiful but one is the ability to simply read directly off your local database the history of your files. Instead of asking a remote server to pull up an older version Git instantly shows the changes. It creates a common space for professionals to work together and keep tabs with their shared projects.</p>
